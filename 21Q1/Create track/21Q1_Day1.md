# Day 1 - Product ideas

[**Day 0** ↼](21Q1_Day0.md)[⇀ **Day 2**](21Q1_Day2.md)

> Today, you will start some research to help you decide between your top 3 ideas.

After the last week of searching you have a list of ideas you want to try out for the challenge. The Day 0 post recommended these ideas to be about _something you already know_, _something that has an accessible audience_, _something the audience will pay for_ and _something that doesn't require a lot of investment or time_. Let's discuss these in detail.

## **Something you already know**

This challenge was originally called _X to 600 in 6 weeks_. The "X" represented the fact that we all start from different places and that those places are not necessarily naught. I ditched it for the simpler "0", but we still all have previous capabilities we can use.

This challenge is against yourself, there are no prizes and no way to cheat, so use all you have. The only reward at the end is whatever you achieve during the six weeks: some cash, a profitable product or knowledge you may use now or later in life.

In any case, use everything you already have to achieve it: an existing product, an existing audience, your existing contacts and, especially, your existing expertise. Not only will it save you precious time but you can use it to build credibility with your would-be customers.

This also applies to the format of the product. If you have written a book before don't try to learn video editing to create a video course, you just don't have time. Unless you outsource it. More on outsourcing and delegating on Day 4.

Finally, if you are still looking for ideas, an easy way to find them is answering the question:
> What do others frequently ask me for advice on or help with?

## **Something that has an accessible audience**

Someone has to want your product. Ensure you have an audience or target market. There are three ways you can have an audience:

- *Already have it*

    You already have a group of interested people you can easily contact. Maybe you've been writing about a topic for some time, you're a social media celebrity or you are the owner of a newsletter on the subject. It's time to monetize that audience.

- *Build it*

    You will one day have the audience described above but you still have to start building it. We will look deeper into building your audience on Day 9.

- *Find it*

    You know where potential customers for your product hang and you have a way to approach them that will peak their interest. Look at social networks like Reddit, web pages like YC's hacker news, Slack or Discord channels, Twitch communities...each product will have its unique audience with their unique habits.

It's better to start with a small highly motivated niche than a large apathetic horde. Don't build something for absolutely everyone.

## **Something the audience will pay for**

You now have an audience interested in your product but, are they willing to pay for it? Furthermore, are they willing to pay a price that will make your idea profitable?

Digital products suffer from issues of differentiation and competition with free content. These are usually solved with a strong creator brand, a link to a known concept or a solution to a crucial customer pain point. What is the reason your audience will pay for your product?

You may also want to start thinking about pricing: what is a price that will balance the willingness to pay of your audience with your need to make a profit? What pricing strategies can you use? We will be looking into pricing in depth on Day 8.

## **Something that doesn't require a lot of investment or time**

We all want to build the next SpaceX, WhatsApp or [insert favourite big thing here]. But this is not the time, not in this workout. Those are projects for after you´ve completed this workout, when you have a second income that allows you to explore higher risk endeavours.

For now, keep it simple, keep it small. You will always have time to grow it once you've demonstrated the audience wants it. In fact build it as small as possible, and if you wish, once you have customers, grow your product together with your community.

## Start with why

Before we move on to researching our ideas, spend a moment reflecting on why you want to build a second income. Write that down somewhere you see it often. Also, what income number are you shooting for and what you'll do once you start earning it. Though we'll develop a habit to build a second income on Day 3, knowing why you are doing this may help you push forwards in moments of low motivation.

## Idea research

Now that you've reflected on your ideas and got the list of your 3 best ones, it's time to test them out. Be as creative as possible and use the best options to gather the information you need to choose your final candidate.

The answers you are looking for are those raised at the beginning of this post. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Ask what we think on the #ideas_qa channel
- Talk to your close friends or family
- Spam an email to your contacts
- Search on Google Trends
- Write a survey and send it to your WhatsApp contacts
- Create a poll on your social networks (Twitter)
- Post to your audience at their usual e-hang-out
- Run competing paid social ad campaigns
- Build landing pages for them and distribute them on social media
- Collect emails of potential customers
- Put together a quick prototype or payment page with a fake door test
- Launch a way to collect pre-orders

Run your research for 24 to 48 hours and see what you can learn about your idea and the customers it will serve.

In the line of the above, you may want to journal your progress to your audience as a way to build a community while creating your product. Many famous creators use this technique (see Gary Vee for one). If there is enough interest we may open a specific channel on journaling, but, for the time being, you can discuss in #creating_qa.

Get researching, gather all the information you can, and tomorrow you'll choose your best idea!
