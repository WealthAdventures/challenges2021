# Day 11 - Sales page that converts

[**Day 10** ↼](21Q1_Day10.md)[⇀ **Day 12**](21Q1_Day12.md)

Today, you'll create your sales page.

## Sale pages

We now have an audience and a channel to communicate to them. We now need to convince them to purchase our product! Before delving into sales and marketing we'll work on the basics: the sale page!

Historically, building a sales page was a complicated technical endeavour, but today, we can use the sale platform to create a simple sales page. Although each of these plarforms will be slightly different here are a set of basic ideas that will be useful for all of them.

The key takeaway is to focus on your customer. You can use the pitch we prepared a few days ago:

    - it focused on the user pain point or need.
    - it documented how the product solved the pain point
    - it highlighted the customer benefits of the product
    - it explains why customers should buy the product

To drive these points across, consider using testimonials, number of units sold, social endorsements or other ways to show the success of the product.

Finally, you may want to include a clear description of what they will be receiving with the purchase.

## Sale platforms

Depending on your product there are different sales platforms you can use to sell your product. Some are more geared to hosting, others to promoting and others are marketplaces. All have their advantages and disadvantages.

The following articles can help you find the best place to sell your product.
