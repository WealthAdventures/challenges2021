# Day 0 - On digital products

> Some of you have been talking about what you will build to complete the challenge, others are still deciding. Have you found an idea that will generate 600 USD in 6 weeks? This document will explore some of your options.

In a week's time, on Day 2 of the workout, we'll have to decide what to build, and as time flies, it's a good idea to start thinking in advance.

We are looking for an idea that will **generate 600 USD in 6 weeks**. LetÂ´s break that dawn:

When I say _generate 600 USD_ I mean it should generate income while you are not working on it. We are not looking to earn money with our time but rather create an asset that generates it. In short, we will invest some time and money to create an asset that will later generate income with limited investment.

_In 6 weeks_ ensures this will be a sprint, not a leisurely walk.

My general tips are to build a product on:

1. **Something you already know**

    Given the time frame for the workout you won't have time to learn something new and create a product around it. Find something you already know well.

2. **Something that has an accessible audience**

    The selling stage of the challenge will be tougher than the build stage. Even more so if we don't build something that is easy to sell. Find an idea that you know people want and ensure you know where to find those people.

3. **Something that doesn't require a lot of investment or time**

    I mean both in the build phase and for the long term maintenance and growth. Time is short, both in the workout and your future life.

My final advice is to keep it as small and simple as possible.

Remember, you are free to approach the challenge however you like, with whatever idea you want. This facilitation track will focus on building a digital product. If that is your cup of tea, welcome and read more below!

## How to make money online

I like Ali Abdaal's classification of the _ways to make money online_ from his [homonymous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH0nNn6SmXw) [youtube.com].

Here is my slightly modified take and an explanation on why I choose to facilitate digital products and not the other options.

0. **Financial games**

    Given the current events, to be exhaustive, I have to mention investing in both traditional instruments and new ones, such as cryptocurrencies. This option falls out of the scope of this workout, both for it's nature as it's complexity.

1. **Services**

    Most of you have probably done this in one way or another, whether for a real life client or a remote one: selling your work and expertise. We are trying to avoid trading time for money and selling your skills as a consultant or on Upwork or Fiverr won't make you money while you sleep.

2. **Products**

    Products covers a wide range of income generation schemes. Selling other people's products via dropshipping or affiliate marketing are good options but the reliance on physical products of the first and the traffic requirements of the second don't fit with the facilitation brief. If you're interested in affiliate marketing, <https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/> might be a good place to start.

    Building and selling our own products is the focus of this facilitation. More concretely selling digital products. I skipped physical products and software products (apps, SaaS...) as they require a larger initial investment.

    Digital products are the ideal candidate for the challenge as they have a one time cost of production, a zero cost of reproduction, near-zero cost of distribution and a low cost of maintenance.

3. **Attention**

    Building attention, an audience or a community is an good way of building a client base for your product. We will look at attention from this angle as anything larger would require more time then that of the workout.

## Examples of digital products

Let's get into the details and look into examples of digital products.

Disclaimer: I am not endorsing and haven't tested any of the examples below. Up to you to decide if they are useful. Use them at your own risk.

### Ebooks

It might be hard to write a book in a few weeks, but you may have already started or you may have a topic you're an expert on or you can write a short manual to speed things up. Write it about the right thing, make sure it's good, and you are up for good sales.

- Technical book. <https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-ed-latimore-s-success-on-gumroad>
- Book on naval. <https://www.navalmanack.com/>

### Online courses, tutorials and guides

Education is changing and online courses, tutorials and guides are here to stay. Platforms like Skillshare or Udemy may even help you get an audience.

- Karate lessons. <https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-jesse-enkamp-s-success-on-gumroad-46b76327-dc7a-4ef3-a801-90f3fe05dc46>
- 100 front-end coding challenges. <https://gumroad.com/l/IuqKc/Ph-30>

### Downloadables

These are files your customers pay you to download. Your imagination is the limit.

- Life planner. <https://gumroad.com/l/bestlife2021>
- Homeschooling curriculum. <https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-kristina-garner-s-success-on-gumroad>

#### Templates, calculators and spreadsheets

A part of downloadables, these have a subsection as they are in vogue right now, you can find a Notion template for everything. But don't forget the vintage version: selling spreadsheets!

- Notion template for project management. <https://www.slashmint.com/notion-pm>
- Notion Zen life planner. <https://gumroad.com/l/zenos>
- Notion growth hacking framework. <https://www.froged.com/ph/growth-hacking-template>

#### Research, data and swipe files

Success stories like NessLabs make these downloadables interesting. You all do research often, imagine if you sold everything you researched!

- Bias list. <https://kickstartsidehustle.com/brainiac/>
- Book summaries. <https://www.readinshort.co/>
- Research reports. <https://nesslabs.com/about>

### Paid newsletters

Newsletters are free, but with a large enough audience in a newsletter you can run a pro version in exchange for cash. Might be hard to pull off in the time frame, but may work well as a long term play.

- Research briefs as newsletter. <https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-dru-riley-s-success-on-gumroad>
- Romantic subscriptions. <https://thelovely.us/products>

### Printables

This should probably be a subset of downloadables, but there are so many people doing this that it gained it's own section. In short, these are downloadable your customers print.

- Code art <https://codeprints.dev/>
- JS & Data Structures Flashcards <https://thecodingcards.com/>
- Scrum cards. <https://letsdoscrum.com/scrum-cards>
- Boardgame. <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brintown/tiny-paper-dungeons> (technically a physical product but doesn't need to be)

### Audio, music, photos & art

A wide category for the more creatively inclined. But don't fool yourself, talking in your own language or accent might just be a business. Platforms like <https://mysoundwise.com/> and <https://www.avocadoaudio.com/> are appearing to monetise your audio. Selling stock photos has been a business for a while and you might just find your shot in a magazine or the next meme.

- French pronunciation. <https://goimitate.com/>
- Original art. <https://gumroad.com/gumroad/p/creator-spotlight-floortje-visser-s-success-on-gumroad>

#### Podcasts

Podcasts are free, but like newsletters you can create a premium podcast with that secret knowledge everyone wants and charge a subscription for it.

### Content creation

I don't think this is the best option. You have to create a lot of content before you make any money. Some new platforms are arising though, like this travel affiliate platform: <https://www.anyplace.com/affiliate>.

### Themes, plugins & other web elements

Though I discarded software as being too investment heavy, there is a large market for Wordpress themes as well as themes and plugins for a variety of software packages. You can also design or build other web elements: see icons as an example, or Figma templates, they are everywhere!

- Paid vscode theme. <https://monokai.pro/vscode>
- Icons. <http://ekremelmas.com/hand-drawn-icons>

If you want to read more on your options you can check the sources I used to write the post:

You may want to think about 3 to 5 ideas as we will be comparing options in the first days before the decision.

Let's discuss further on the #digital-product channel!

## What to expect

To end the Day 0 post, I want to highlight that the first two weeks of the workout will be inspired by Gumroad's 14 Day Product Challenge. If you want to see that for yourself and get ahead of the workout, you can enrol below for daily emails and access to their resources: <https://gumroad.com/l/BLwER>

Finally, if you want to know what to expect from a similar experience to the first two weeks of this workout, one of the participants of Gumroad's 14 Day Product Challenge (and Gumroad employee) journaled their experience here:

Have a great week, a good think on your ideas and see you on Discord!
