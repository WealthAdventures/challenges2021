# **Wealth Adventures** workout Q1.21

        ⟼ Are you looking to improve your finances or reduce your income risk? Do you want to achieve financial freedom?

        ⟼ Do you think the future of work is the gig economy? That we are trending towards digital jobs with laxer job security? Looking to get ahead of the curve?

        ⟼ Can you not find a job you like? Do you want to work within your values? Do you want to monetise your knowledge and expertise?

Building a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">second income</span> might be the answer you’re looking for.

If you’ve thought about experimenting with alternative incomes but have no idea on how or when to start, worry not: neither do we, but we’ve envisioned a way to discover and learn with a group of like-minded peers.

If this sounds interesting, read on to learn more about this workout, featuring:

* **Start me up**, your group of like-minded peers (or mastermind group), and
* **0 to 600 in 6 weeks**, the challenge that will help us learn about second incomes and start generating one.

Welcome to Wealth Adventures!

## What is **_Start me up_**?

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Start me up</span>_ is a challenge-focused mastermind group. Its objective is to support its members during the _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">0 to 600 in 6w</span>_ challenge defined below.

A mastermind groups is [^1]:

    “The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.”

The members of the group will offer **mutual support, differing perspectives, access to resources and accountability** to other members pursuing the challenge.

Participating in the mastermind group requires a **commitment to support its other members**. Even if you drop out of the challenge before the final week, you will be **expected to attend the seven meetings** listed below and help out your fellow members.

The mastermind group will be run remotely and will provide:

* **1 launch meeting**, via video conference
* **6 one-hour meetings**, via video conference, weekly on Saturday evenings GMT / mornings PST
* **An async platform** to support, communicate and share between meetings (Discord)
* A degree of structure and **some facilitation** along the challenge

## What is the **_0 to 600 in 6 weeks_** challenge?

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Start me up</span>_ members challenge themselves to achieve the following in **6 weeks**:

1. **Launch** a valuable and ethical income generating idea
2. **Generate 600 USD** of income
3. **Spend under 500 USD** to do so

That’s all!

## Why this workout

Wealth adventures is an open knowledge initiative encouraging personal freedom by means of wealth.

1. A simple way to acquire wealth is by earning a second income.
2. A simple way to earn a second income is by owning cash generating assets.
3. A simple way to own a cash generating asset is to build and launch it.
4. An easier way to build and launch an asset is with a support system.
5. The only way to build and launch is fast.
6. The best time to sell is now.

Hence a 6 week workout (mastermind group + challenge) to build, launch and sell your idea with the support of a group of peers.

## What this workout is not

* Not a planning or theoretical exercise. Expect to do. And do a lot.
* Not an easy challenge. It will be tough. As a respect to others members, commit to supporting the group before joining.
* Not anything to do with startups (despite the title). Launching a startup is a different kind of problem.
* Not a course, class, lesson or coaching session.
* Not a follow along instruction book. Hand holding will be limited and you are expected to lead your own efforts to achieve the challenge.
* Not a way to outsource work to other members. Members are here to support you, not work for you.
* Not a place where illegal or unethical behaviours will be tolerated. The group is self governing and is free to expel members or report misbehaviour to authorities.
* Not a proven method. In fact it’s an experiment. We’re all here to discover, learn together and support each other. We will adapt or change whatever we need to achieve the challenge.

## On the first edition

This is the first edition of _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Start me up</span>_ group and the _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">0 to 600 in 6w</span>_ challenge. As such, they will change and adapt to cater the needs of the group members.

The group will have a minimum of 2 members and a maximum of 6, including the facilitator. The challenge will start Sunday 7th of February 2021 and will end the 20th of March 2021.

Though you are free to create any income generating idea you prefer, the facilitation will favour the creation, launch and sale of a digital asset with the potential for long term revenue generation with minimal re-investment. For example digital books, courses, newsletters or reports. We chose this facilitation as it is the path of least resistance to start building your wealth.[^2]

The first two weeks will focus on building and launching your product and the four last weeks will focus on generating revenue with your product. We will have a Launch Day after the second week, so expect to launch your product then.

Taking into account this facilitation, the _Why this workout_ can be restated as:

_“Wealth adventures is an open knowledge initiative encouraging personal freedom by means of wealth._

1. _A simple way to acquire wealth is by earning a second income._
2. _A simple way to earn a second income is by owning cash generating assets._
3. _A simple way to own a cash generating asset is to build a scalable product._
4. _A simple form of scalable product is a digital product._
5. _An easier way to launch a digital product is with a support system._
6. _The only way to build and launch is fast._
7. _The best time to sell is now._

_Hence a 6 week workout_ (mastermind group + challenge) _to build, launch and sell a digital product with the support of a group of peers.”_

Digital products are not the only option and have issues of their own, such as competition from free content and piracy, but they offer a way to start with a low investment and they are a great tool to learn.

The final goal of this challenge group is for you to 1) put down the first stone of your wealth creation engine and to 2) learn a repeatable process to continue building it in the future.

In the best case scenario you will generate some cash and flex your entrepreneurship muscle, in the worst you will learn something and have helped generate a body of knowledge to share freely with others.

Stay the course and adventure on!
