# **Start me up:** Agenda & prep

Welcome to the first iteration of the first Wealth Adventures workout[^1]. In preparation for the launch on the 7th of February, I invite you to start preparing now!

1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/) [discord.gg] and introduce yourself in the #general channel.

2. Think about how you are going to beat the challenge. You are free to approach it how you like. You can start by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH0nNn6SmXw) [youtube.com] to see what options you may try[^2]. My general advice is "build something you already know a lot about".

If you are looking to follow the optional _digital product facilitation_ see the **Day 0** message on the #digital-product channel for some tips (coming soon).

The rest of the document presents the agenda, so you can see what is in store.

## Mastermind group

The mastermind group, titled _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Start me up</span>_, is the formal part of the workout. The goal of this group is to support its members as they attempt the challenge. It will consist of a series of meetings with a predefined agenda.

Expect to give and receive the following from the mastermind group.

- Support during the challenge
- Differing perspectives and feedback
- Access to new resources (at the discretion of the members)
- Accountability toward beating the challenge

### Agenda

The Mastermind meetings will be:

**7th Feb** - Launch meeting

**13th Feb** -First mastermind meeting

**20th Feb** - Launch Day

**27th Feb** - Second mastermind meeting

**6th Mar** - Third mastermind meeting

**13th Mar** - Fourth mastermind meeting

**20th Mar** - Challenge graduation

For each meeting there will be a facilitator, running the meeting and a note taker, taking the meeting minutes. These roles are rotating and different members may perform them in different meetings.

I encourage you to attend all these meetings as they are the core of the experience. They will take place on Saturday evenings GMT to accommodate all timezones.

#### Launch meeting

In the launch meeting, after a brief introduction, each member will introduce themselves by answering the questions:

- Who are you
- What are you expecting from the workout
- What are you going to create and sell
- How do you think you can help others
- How do you think we can help you

#### Mastermind meetings

In the four mastermind meetings we will report on progress toward the goal and support each other with feedback, learnings and resources. Each member will address the questions:

1. What are you working on
2. What did you learn
3. What do you need help with

#### Launch Day

The launch day is a specific mastermind meeting where members will present their products. I encourage you to launch by this date so you can start selling on week three, but this is a suggestion. You may present your project even if you haven't launched.

Each member will address the questions:

1. What have you built
2. What did you learn
3. How are you going to sell it
4. How can we help

#### Challenge graduation

The final wrap up meeting. We'll look to answer the points:

1. Did you succeed
2. What did you learn
3. What are your next steps
4. How can we improve the workout
5. Final takeaways

## Challenge

The challenge, titled _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">0 to 600 in 6 weeks</span>_, is personal to each member and is their own responsibility, though other members will offer support in the meetings and channels. The challenge consists on doing the following in **6 weeks**:

1. **Launch** a valuable and ethical income generating idea
2. **Generate 600 USD** of income
3. **Spend under 500 USD** to do so

### Facilitation

The facilitation is an optional path to attempt the challenge with a passive-income generating asset, in particular a low-maintenance digital product. It will be loosely based on the [Gumroad University](https://gumroad.com/university) [gumroad.com] resources.

It has two tracks, one for the first two weeks focused on building, and a second the last four weeks focused on selling. You can follow both tracks on the #digital-product channel.

#### Create track

The create track runs during the first 2 weeks and provides daily updates on how to build a digital product. Here is an overview. Topics are subject to change to align with member interests.

**Day 0** - Digital products

**Day 1** - Product Idea

**Day 2** - Outline product

**Day 3** - Creating a habit

**Day 4** - Creating your product

**Day 5** - Naming your product

**Day 6** - A product that sells

**Day 7** - Preparing the launch - Pre-order option

**Day 8** - Pricing your product

**Day 9** - Building an audience

**Day 10** - Finalising your product - Emailing list option

**Day 11** - Creating a sales page

**Day 12** - Launch plan

**Day 13** - Test and review

**Day 14** - Launch

#### Sell track

The sell track runs the last four weeks and will consist on more open weekly discussions on different topics related to generating income. Topics are subject to change to align with member interests.

**Week 1** - Set up the basics

**Week 2** - Find your customers - Community option

**Week 3** - Automation - Keeping the workload small

**Week 4** - Growing income

## Digital platform

We will use the digital platform to exchange between meetings and share learning as we go along. It's both a tool to manage the remote mastermind group, a resource to help succeed at the challenge and the community around this effort.

The channels on the platform will evolve according to the needs of the group. At tht time being they are:

### Information channels

These are the more official channels that we'll use for announcements, to document the meetings, and for the facilitation.

- `#announcements` : The official announcements channel for the workout.

- `#mmm` : (mastermind meeting minutes) We will share the mastermind meeting  notes here after each meeting.

- `#digital-product` : I will be running the optional digital product facilitation on this channel. Expect regular messages during the challenge.

### Text channels

- `#general`: The main channel for the platform. Post any non-specific messages.

- `#resources` : Share resources that can help members complete the challenge.

- `#creating_qa` : Ask questions and provide answers about creating an income generating idea.

- `#selling_qa` : Ask questions and provide answers about selling an income generating idea.

- `#open-questions` : A place to discuss open questions on second incomes (ex. Is it worth the effort or would working in your domain provide more returns?)

- `#improvements` : Tell me what we can improve to make this experience better.

- `#off-topic` : Post about any topic not related to the workout.
